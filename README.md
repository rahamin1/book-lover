## My react/redux 'graduation' project
- In the beginning of 2017 I started, in my spare time and by my own, learning and experiencing with the following: Javascript, React, Redux, Bootstrap, Firebase
- In the first month of 2018 I developed my ‘self learning graduation mini project’. 
This is the source code for this project.
- A demo of can be found [here](https://book-lover.herokuapp.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
