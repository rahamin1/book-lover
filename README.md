## My react/redux 'graduation' project
- In the beginning of 2017 I started, in my spare time and on my own, learning and experiencing with the following: Javascript, React, Redux, Bootstrap, Firebase and various libraries (e.f. redux-persist, redux-thunk)
- In the first month of 2018 I developed my ‘self learning graduation mini project’. 
This is the source code for this project.
- It is simple, even primitive, I know, but, in addition to using firebase and bootstrap it is using the libraries mentioned above and others, implements some useful components (e.g. modals), so under the hood it gave me a lot of experience
- A demo of can be found [here](https://book-lover.herokuapp.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
